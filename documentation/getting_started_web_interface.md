# Getting Started Open Echo Interface Software

The [***Open Echo Web Interface***](echo_interface.py) is a cross-platform Python application that interacts with the Arduino + TUSS4470 Shield. 
It displays ultrasonic echo data in real-time in the browser using a waterfall chart visualization. 
<!-- The application is intended primarily as a testing and development tool, but is stable enough for continuous use -tested for several days on a Raspberry Pi 4 without issues. -->

### Key Features
- Connects to Open Echo hardware over serial
- Displays real-time and historical data in a waterfall chart
<!-- - Auto-gain to adjust the waterfall chart colors -->
- Shows detected depth <!-- and (if supported) temperature and drive voltage (`vDRV`) -->
<!-- - Supports bidirectional communication for debugging and testing -->
- Shows depth at cursor on hover - useful for precise depths of non-ground echoes (fish!)

> **Note**  
> This interface is primarily intended for development and testing. It's proven stable, but not yet a polished end-user application.

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Install openecho
```bash
pip install openecho
```

### 2. Start Open Echo Interface Software
Run the following command to start the web server. 
```bash
openecho web
```
Then go to http://localhost:8000. The first connection will be redirected to /config to set up the connection, then you should see your echoes.
