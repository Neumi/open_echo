Getting started guides for Open Echo.

First, you will need the [Open Echo TUSS4470 Arduino Shield](documentation/getting_started/TUSS4470_hardware.md).

This repository provides two software components to support the TUSS4470 Arduino Shield:
- [Arduino Firmware](documentation/getting_started/TUSS4470_firmware.md) - Runs on an Arduino UNO board with the TUSS4470 shield and handles signal generation, echo capture, and communication.
- [Open Echo Interface](documentation/getting_started/desktop_interface.md) - A desktop application that communicates with the Arduino, displays echo data as a real-time waterfall chart, and will soon allow runtime configuration of the system.
