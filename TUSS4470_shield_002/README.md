# open_echo TUSS4470 development shield

The TUSS4470 Arduino Shield is a board to test the TUSS4470 capabilities using the Arduino UNO platform.

The TUSS4470 is an ultrasonic driver and receiver IC that makes is easy to use ultrasonic transducers with Arduino.

This lets you get started quickly and test software on the Arduino to drive the TUSS4470.

It is designed to be easily ordered at JLCPCB or other board houses.

The Arduino Software, together with the Python backend, lets you test different transducers and configurations. 

Change the drive frequency in the Arduino file accordingly. The Arduino example drives the transducer at 228kHz to use [THIS](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005004870967523.html) type of transducer.
