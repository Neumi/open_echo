# Getting Started Open Echo Interface Software

The [***Open Echo Interface***](echo_interface.py) is a cross-platform Python application that interacts with the Arduino + TUSS4470 Shield. 
It displays ultrasonic echo data in real-time using a waterfall chart visualization. 
The application is intended primarily as a testing and development tool, but is stable enough for continuous use -tested for several days on a Raspberry Pi 4 without issues.

### Key Features
- Connects to Open Echo hardware over serial
- Displays real-time and historical data in a waterfall chart
- Auto-gain to adjust the waterfall chart colors
- Shows detected depth, and (if supported) temperature and drive voltage (`vDRV`)
- Supports bidirectional communication for debugging and testing

> **Note**  
> This interface is primarily intended for development and testing. It's proven stable, but not yet a polished end-user application.

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
cd open_echo/TUSS4470_shield_002
python3 -m venv venv 
source venv/bin/activate 
```

### 2. Install requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

### 3. Start Open Echo Interface Software
```bash
python echo_interface.py
```

Select the correct COM port, then click Connect or press c on your keyboard. Once connected, the Open Echo board will begin streaming data, which will appear on the right side of the interface.
The red horizontal line indicates the currently detected depth, based on the strongest first echo received after the ring-down delay.

### 4. Change to your own needs

You can change different settings in the first lines of the [**Open Echo Interface**](echo_interface.py) code to customize it to your specific use cases.

### ðŸ“Š Parameter Settings

| Parameter         | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `BAUD_RATE`       | Must match the baud rate configured in the Arduino firmware. |
| `NUM_SAMPLES`     | Must match the `NUM_SAMPLES` value used in the Arduino firmware. |
| `MAX_ROWS`        | Sets the number of historical measurements displayed in the chart before it scrolls. |
| `Y_LABEL_DISTANCE`| Defines the vertical axis label spacing, in centimeters. |
| `SPEED_OF_SOUND`  | Used to convert sample timing into distance. Set to ~330 for air, ~1450 for water. |
| `SAMPLE_TIME`     | Sampling interval in microseconds. For the Arduino UNO with [TUSS4470_arduino.ino](TUSS4470_arduino/TUSS4470_arduino.ino), this must be set to **13.2 Âµs**. |
